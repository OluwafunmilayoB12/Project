Recently, leadership noticed that **the technical debt of 33% was accumulated during the period of growth at all cost between July and August 2025, engineering leadership was facing significant **operational friction**.

### Problem Statement
 TechNova is experiencing significant operational friction and accumulated technical debt that built up during the "growth-at-all-cost" phase, this affects the CTO & Engineering Managers by increasing the platform inefficiency and stability.
 We need to run Root Cause Analysis & trend analysis to perform a full audit of all cloud resources,
 to identify and reduce technical debt and critical vulnerabilities, aiming to lower the percentage of affected resources to below 5% and decrease the total vulnerability count by at least 60% after remediation.
